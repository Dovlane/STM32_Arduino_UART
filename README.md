# STM32 Arduino UART

## Introduction
The aim of this report is to introduce working with the STM32 Nucleo board and the Arduino UNO, through theoretical notes and a practical example. The example will include these two devices as well as the UART protocol, which serves as the communication protocol between them.

## Assumptions
The assumptions in this document are that the user possesses basic knowledge of STM microcontrollers and is familiar with the process of programming them in the STM32CubeIDE development environment. The same assumption applies to the Arduino UNO and its development environment in the Arduino IDE. The final assumption is that the user has basic prior knowledge of how the UART protocol functions.

## Task Idea
In short, the idea of this task is to use the STM32 (blue) user button to toggle the light on and off on an LED connected to the Arduino UNO via a breadboard.
